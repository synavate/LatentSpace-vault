## User Privacy is one of five cornerstones of Synavate & it's software

Our flagship product, `Synapse` is an insight ric application. It is only in early development but what it requires is the inclusion of individual ideas to generate connections. Not only does the data provided store and organize your thoughts, ideas and epiphanies - it expands and extends this.

The data stored contributes to your own personal network of expanding insights. In short:

**Synapse will transform raw information from data eg. your `tweets` from `X` or your `Notes App eg. Obsidian` or as an `Organization` your traditional database. Transform it from raw data into insights drawn from unrelated, disparate areas. Without the outlays of an expensive, difficult to maintain data systems and infrastructure**

This is the goal. Like the graphs it will produce it will expand.

Regardless, 
Private user data should and will remain private.
Confidential organisational IP will remain confidential.

You will have both have control WITH the power of Synapse.


Each entity will be able to benefit as an `organisation`, `association`, `department` or `individual` from Synapse. We want to ensure that regardless of your obligations legally, fidicuary or personally.

From this perspective the User Vault (Latent Space) is a critical feature.

**We're exploring the options available to us in this space and welcome input by the Community**
